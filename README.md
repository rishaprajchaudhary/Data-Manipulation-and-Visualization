# Data Manipulation and Visualization using Python

This repository demonstrates how to perform data manipulation and visualization using Python, focusing on regression analysis and graphical representation of results.

## Features

- **Data Loading:** Read and preprocess data from CSV files using pandas.
- **Regression Analysis:** Apply linear regression to predict outcomes based on input features.
- **Visualization:** Generate clear and informative plots using matplotlib to illustrate relationships in the data and model predictions.
- **Performance Metrics:** Calculate and display metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score.

## Usage

1. Place your dataset (CSV file) in the project directory.
2. Run the Python script and provide the filename when prompted:
   ```bash
   python regression.py
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to view results and visualizations.

## Example Output

- Tabular display of data and predictions
- Performance metrics (MSE, R-squared)
- Graphs showing actual data points and regression lines

## Files Description

- `regression.py`: Python script for data manipulation, regression analysis, and visualization.
- `sample.csv`: Example dataset for testing and demonstration.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
